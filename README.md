# Rubik's Cube Simulation with GUI

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating a Rubik's Cube. It allows users to shuffle, reset, and manipulate the cube via various face moves and visualization of the cube's state.

## Features

- **Shuffle** the cube randomly.
- **Reset** the cube to its original solved state.
- **Undo** the last move.
- Perform face moves (U, R, F, L, D, B and their inverses).
- Rotate the cube along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- A timer to track the duration from shuffle to solving.
- A move counter to keep track of the number of moves made.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Kivy library (for GUI)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rubiks-cube.git

   pip install kivy
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the "Shuffle" button to mix up the cube.
3. Perform moves using the buttons corresponding to face rotations.
4. Track your time and moves in the displayed labels.
5. Use the "Undo" button to revert the last move.
